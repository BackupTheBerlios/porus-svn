- Major API change to control system.  The two-stage design is new, and allows us to move the control parsing etc. into a thread.  This is documented.
- status struct is now global, and no longer passed around as a parameter
- changed stdctl.c to ctl.c.  Will in future try to move all the non-hardware control system code there.
- split up the standard control handlers into read and write functions, changed them to fit the new API
- Added a new config parameter, ctlWriteBufLen, which defines the length 
in bytes of the control recieve array
- Control receive array is now global and we declare it in usbconfig.c

- usbdescgen was generating a bad endpoints array.  This showed up for IN endpoints.  Fixed
- (usbstdctl.c) Some of the standard control message handlers were misinterpreting the index field for IN endpoints.  Fixed
- IN endpoints had screwed-up register setup routines.  Fixed
- Check for transaction-in-progress during IN interrupt was broken.  Fixed
- Now initialising configuration 1 endpoint data structures during usb_init()
