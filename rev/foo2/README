PORUS: Portable USB Stack version 0.1.0
=========================

PORUS is a portable USB device stack. It is designed to contain, as far as
possible, all of the code common to a complete USB device implementation.

PORUS is not finished. Until version 1.0.0, the API may change, perhaps
drastically. It is not considered stable.

At this time, only one port is available. It runs on the MMB0 DSP board,
which uses the Texas Instruments TMS320VC5507 DSP. More ports are planned.

Files
-----

The distribution contains the following:

doc/ - Documentation
port/ - Ports, with one directory per port
src/ - Source code and header files
test/ - A tester
usbgen/ - Code generator for static structures and enumeration code
NEWS - Version news
CHANGELOG - Detailed change log
README - This file
VERSION - Version number

Documentation
-------------

At present, PORUS has no unified handbook. The API is documented in
formatted (for Doxygen) comments in the header files.

Contributions to the documentation (or any other part of PORUS) are welcomed
and solicited.

Basic setup for a project
-------------------------

PORUS is distributed as source files, some of which are generated by usbgen.

To use PORUS, you need the following:

- On Windows, Cygwin is highly recommended. See www.cygwin.com. Cygwin
provides a Unix-like shell environment. From this you can easily run usbgen.

- Python, to run usbgen. This is available for free for nearly all modern
operating systems from www.python.org, and is also available as a Cygwin
package.

To set up PORUS in your project:

1. Install usbgen. See usbgen/INSTALL for instructions. (The PORUS source
code has no installation procedure; copy it into your project's source
directory.)

2. Write a configuration file for usbgen. This is most easily done by
editing the example configuration file usbgen/example.usbconf. It contains
detailed comments.

3. In your project's directory, run usbgen on the configuration file you
made. This will generate usbconf.c and usbconf.h.

4. Choose a port. If no port is available for your architecture, one will
have to be written. At this time, only one port is available. It runs on the
TMS320VC5509A and TMS320VC5507 DSPs using the inbuilt USB peripheral on
those devices.

5. Copy the port source files to your project.

6. Copy the core source files in src/ to your project.
