- usbdescgen was generating a bad endpoints array.  This showed up for IN endpoints.  Fixed
- (usbstdctl.c) Some of the standard control message handlers were misinterpreting the index field for IN endpoints.  Fixed
- IN endpoints had screwed-up register setup routines.  Fixed
- Check for transaction-in-progress during IN interrupt was broken.  Fixed
- Now initialising configuration 1 endpoint data structures during usb_init()
