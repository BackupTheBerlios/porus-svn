//! USB setup packet
/*! usb_setup_t holds all of the fields in a USB setup packet, together with a few fields used by the stack for data phases.  It is passed to control callbacks.

The fields in this structure carry all the information needed to deduce a transaction's progress at any time.  In a setup write transaction, assuming the host is behaving properly, you can find out the following:

- If there is no data phase, #len is zero.
- If there is a data phase, #len is nonzero.
- If the data phase is split, #len is nonzero and greater than #datalen.
- You have reached the last packet in the data phase when 
  <tt>bytect + USB_CTL_PACKET_SIZE</tt> is greater than #len.

For a setup read transaction:

- If there is no data phase, #len is zero.
- If there is a data phase, #len is nonzero, and you must supply data.
- If #len is greater than <tt>USB_CTL_PACKET_SIZE</tt>, you must split 
  the transaction.

There are two ways to run a split data read transaction.  The first method is to point #data at the beginning of your buffer and set #datalen to the total amount of data you want to return.  If #datalen is longer than \c USB_CTL_PACKET_SIZE, the stack will automatically split the packet by "walking" it.  If the host has requested \e less data than you have to send, only that amount of data will be sent.

The second method requires a little more work, but is useful when you need
more control, or if you are generating data on the fly or reading it from a
special peripheral (to mention two examples). The trick is this: if #datalen 
is equal to \c USB_CTL_PACKET_SIZE, \e and #len is 
longer than #datalen, the stack will send #datalen bytes, and it will then 
call you, asking for more data.  It will keep calling you until it has sent 
#len bytes or until you set #datalen to something less than USB_CTL_PACKET_SIZE, 
which causes the stack to send a short packet, which ends the transaction.

Before the stack calls you, if fills out the setup structure with values it thinks are
appropriate.  You are free to alter (some of) these values at
that time, and the stack will honour your alterations (as long as they make
sense)!  The values you can alter are #data, #dataofs, and #datalen. You should 
\e never alter any of the standard USB fields, and you should <em>never, 
ever alter the #bytect field;</em> doing the former will probably get you into
serious trouble, and doing the latter will definitely get you into serious 
trouble.

The #dataofs field may seem a bit of a waste, but it's needed during read 
transactions for systems 
which use byte packing to store USB packet data, where it can save you a 
lot of work.  If portability is a 
concern, you should always favour it over merely altering #data.  
See the documentation for #dataofs for details.
